# CFL Converter
THIS IS JUST A BAD FORK OF https://github.com/dhkatz/cfl-converter

#HOW TO USE THE RUN.BAT
you need to make a folder structure like this ROOT FOLDER\DO NOT DELETE\7z\ and place all the contents of the 7zip exe in it

root folder can be named whatever but the run.bat needs to be in the root folder


all I did was make it count up from 1 to whatever url 404's instead of down from 100 and added parallel downloading to make it MUCH FASTER

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dhkatz/cfl-converter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dhkatz/cfl-converter) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cfl-converter.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/cfl-converter)

Convert from IMVU's CFL format to a file usable by the client create mode (.chkn).

In reality, a .chkn file is just a zip archive and can be opened as such.

Inspired by https://github.com/Toyz/LibCFL

## Usage

### Library

This package can also be integrated into your own program.

You can `import { convert } from 'cfl-converter';` and call the function with an `ArrayBufferLike` (such as a Buffer) containing the contents of
a CFL file (and any supported options in the second parameter).

A `decompress(data: ArrayBufferLike)` function is also provided if you would like to manually decompress the LZMA portions of the CFL.

### Command Line Tool

Convert .cfl files to .chkn files using this easy command-line tool!

Product IDs can also be supplied and the program will attempt to download them and convert them.

```
Usage: cfl-converter [options]

Options:
  -V, --version         output the version number
  -I, --input <files>   .CFL file(s) to convert.
  -P, --products <ids>  List of Product IDs to retrieve and convert.
  -h, --help            output usage information

Examples:
  $ cfl-converter --input product.cfl,chair.cfl
  $ cfl-converter --products 1243456,654321
```

## Testing

Testing is currently being written, although the program itself is quite simple.

## Details

The signifiance of this is, that due to what I can only call a CDN exploit, you can download the CFL for ANY product in the shop!

This can be accomplished by running the product ID through the url `http://userimages-akm.imvu.com/productdata/{productID}/1` where `{productID}` is the ID of the product you with to retrieve. 

The number at the end seems to be the revision number, so you may want to check if numbers higher than 1 work as well and get the highest revision you can.

After, simply save the downloaded file with a .cfl extension and use this tool to convert it to a CHKN file.
